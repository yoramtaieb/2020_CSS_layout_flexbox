                <h3>The Ultimate Guide to Flexbox </h3>
                <p>

                    The Flex Layout module is new layout module in CSS3 made to improve the items align, directions and
                    order in the container even when they are with dynamic or even unknown size. The prime
                    characteristic of
                    the flex container is the ability to modify the width or height of its children to fill the
                    available
                    space in the best possible way on different screen sizes.

                <p>
                    Flexbox is relatively new, but it enjoys excellent browser support today (nearly 83% of browsers
                    support
                    Flexbox). Flexbox Layout is used for small application components, whereas CSS Grid Layout Module is
                    aimed to handle the large scale layouts.

                <h3>The Two axes of Flexbox</h3>
                <p>


                    When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes ? the main axis and the cross axis.
                    The
                    main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.
                    Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work
                    from
                    the outset.
